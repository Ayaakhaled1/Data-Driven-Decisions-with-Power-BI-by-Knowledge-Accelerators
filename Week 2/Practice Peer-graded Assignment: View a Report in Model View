he assignment: Take a look at your dataset in the Model view. Share an image or screenshot of the view via upload.

Once you have shared an image of your dataset in Model view, write your responses to the following prompts in the submission field:

What are the relationships, or joining fields, that exist? 

What are the Field options?

How might you manipulate the data to learn more? For example:

  Are you able to edit or delete relationships to create visualizations? 

  How about using the cardinality drop-down to determine which joining fields have unique or multiple instances per value?

  Are there any other ways you can experiment with the data to create accurate visualizations or extract useful data about existing relationships?
